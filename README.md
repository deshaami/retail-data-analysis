# Retail Data Analysis for Supermarkets

A comprehensive data analysis and machine learning solution to optimize operations and boost profitability for small and medium supermarkets.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to empower supermarkets with data-driven insights by leveraging classification algorithms and market basket analysis.

Key functionalities include:

- **Inventory Management:** Track stock levels and optimize reorder points.  
- **Item Management:** Analyze item performance and sales trends.  
- **Customer Analysis:** Segment customers and predict buying behaviors using machine learning models.

---

## Methodology

- Tested classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.  
- Selected Random Forest as the best performing model with precision (0.89), recall (0.86), and F1-score (0.85).  
- Applied the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis to identify frequent itemsets and associations in transactional data.  
- Developed a user-friendly front-end interface to visualize and update inventory and billing information.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
- Apriori algorithm implementation for association rule mining  
- Front-end development for inventory and billing system  
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

---

## Results

- Identified top-selling items and item associations to inform marketing strategies.  
- Improved inventory management through predictive analytics.  
- Enabled customer segmentation for targeted promotions.

---

## Future Work

- Integration with real-time POS systems.  
- Enhanced predictive models for customer lifetime value (CLV).  
- Deployment as a full-stack web application.
